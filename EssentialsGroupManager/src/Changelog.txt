Changelog

v 1.1:
	- Fixed users being able to use 'manuadd' to add users to higher groups than their own.
	- Added SuperPerms support so GM will update and provide the permissions to plugins which only support Bukkit Perms.
	- Added more helpful output to errors on argument lengths.
	- GroupManager will now attempt to select the default world when using commands instead of failing and telling you to use '/manselect <world>'.
