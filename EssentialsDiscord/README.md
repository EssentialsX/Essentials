## Initial Setup

0. Before starting your server, there are a few steps you have to take. First, you must create a new
discord bot at [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).

1. Once on that page, click on "New Application" button on the top right, give your bot a name, and
then click "Create".
> ![Creating Application](https://i.imgur.com/8ffp4R1.gif)
> `New Application` -> Give Application a Name -> `Create`

2. Once you create the application, you'll be directed to its overview. From this screen, you'll
need to copy your "Client ID" and save it for a later step. To copy your client id, click the
upper-left most blue "Copy" button. Make sure to save it for a later step.
> ![Copy Client ID](https://i.imgur.com/W3OMTu5.gif)
> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step

3. Optionally, you can set an icon for your application as it will be the icon for the bot too.
> ![Avatar](https://i.imgur.com/NuFS9kT.png)

4. The next step is actually creating a bot user for your application. From the overview screen,
this is done by going to the "Bot" tab on the left, then clicking the "Add Bot" on the right,
and finally then clicking "Yes, do it!".
> ![Create Bot](https://i.imgur.com/S14iAFS.gif)
> `Bot` -> `Add Bot` -> `Yes, do it!`

5. Once on this screen, you'll need to uncheck the "Public Bot" setting and then click "Save Changes",
so other people can't add your bot to servers that are not your own.
> ![Disable Public Bot](https://i.imgur.com/HHqWvQ1.gif)
> Uncheck `Public Bot` -> `Save Changes`

6. Finally, you'll need to copy your bot's token and save it for a later step. To copy your bot's token,
click the blue "Copy" button right of your bot's icon. Make sure to save it for a later step.
> ![Copy Token](https://i.imgur.com/OqpaSQH.gif)
> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step
   
9. Next up is adding your bot to your discord server. First, goto [essentialsx.net/discord.html](https://essentialsx.net/discord.html)
and paste your Client ID you copied from step 2 into the text box on that page. Once you do that, click
the "Authorize" button next to the text box. This will redirect you to Discord's authorization website 
to chose which server to add the bot to. Note for advanced users: Please use the `essentialsx.net` website above 
even if you think you already know how to invite bots. Bots for EssentialsXDiscord require more than just the `bot`
scope to work, so please just use the link above even if you think you know what you're doing.
> ![OAuth Link Gen](https://i.imgur.com/u6MFJgQ.gif)
> Paste Client ID -> `Authorize`

10. Once on the Discord authorization website, select the server from the "Select a server" dropdown 
that you want to add the bot to. Then click the "Authorize" button. You may be prompted to confirm
you are not a bot, proceed with that like you would any other captcha.
> ![Authorize](https://i.imgur.com/KXkESqC.gif)
> Select Server -> `Authorize`

11. For the next few steps, you're going to need to do some stuff in discord, so start up your
Discord desktop/web client. 

12. Once in your Discord client, you'll need to enable developer mode. Do this by going into the 
Settings, then go to the "Appearance" tab and check on the "Developer Mode" at the bottom of the
page. Once you've checked "Developer Mode" on, click the `X` at the top right to exit Settings.
> ![Developer Mode](https://i.imgur.com/CrW31Up.gif)
> `User Settings` -> `Appearance` -> Check `Developer Mode` -> Exit Settings

13. Next is copying a few IDs. First up, you'll want to copy the server (aka guild) id. Do this by
finding the server you added the bot to, right click its icon, and click "Copy ID". Once you copied
it, make sure to save it for a later step.
> ![Guild ID](https://i.imgur.com/0mg2yT3.gif)
> Right click server -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step

14. The other ID you need to copy is the ID of the channel you wish to be your primary channel.
In other words, this will be the channel that, by default, receives messages for player chat/join/leave/death
messages as well as mute/kicks. To see how to further configure message types, see [Configuring Messages](#configuring-messages).
> ![Primary Channel ID](https://i.imgur.com/uMODfiQ.gif)
> Right click your 'primary' channel -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step

15. You've successfully copied all the necessary IDs needed for a basic setup. Next up is generating the
default config for EssentialsXDiscord, so you can start setting it up! Do this by putting the
EssentialsXDiscord jar (you can download it [here](https://essentialsx.net/downloads.html) if you do not
already have one) in your plugins folder, starting your server, and then stopping it as soon as it finishes
starting up.
> ![Start/Stop Server](https://i.imgur.com/JQX6hqM.gif)
> Drag EssentialsXDiscord jar into plugins folder -> Start Server -> Stop Server

16. Now you can start to configure the plugin with all the stuff you copied from earlier. Open the config
for EssentialsXDiscord located at `plugins/EssentialsDiscord/config.yml`. When you open the config, the
first thing to configure is your bot's token. Replace `INSERT-TOKEN-HERE` in the config with the token you
copied earlier from step 6.
> ![Paste Token](https://i.imgur.com/EnD31Wg.gif)
> Re-Copy Token from Step 6 -> Paste as token value 

17. Next, is the guild id, replace the zeros for the guild value in the config with the guild id you copied
from step 13.
> ![Paste Guild](https://i.imgur.com/YxkHykd.gif)

18. Finally, you'll need to paste the primary channel id you copied from step 14 and paste it as the
primary value in the channels section and once you've done that save the config file!
> ![Paste Primary](https://i.imgur.com/4xaHMfO.gif)

19. Congratulations, you've completed the initial setup guide! When you start up your server, you should
notice that chat and other messages start showing up in the channel you requested they be. Now that you
completed the initial, go back up to the [Table Of Contents](#table-of-contents) to see what other cool things you can do!

## Console Relay
The console relay is pretty self-explanatory: it relays everything on your console into discord channel of
your choosing. The console relay is ridiculously easy to setup and if your server is already running, you don't
need to reload it!

0. This assumes you've already done the initial setup.

1. Go to the discord server that your bot is in and find the channel you wish to use for console output.
Right click on the channel and click "Copy ID". Save this id for the next step.
> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/qvDfSLv.gif)
> Find console channel -> Right Click -> `Copy ID`

2. Now that you have that copied, open the EssentialsXDiscord config and find the `console` section. In that
section, replace the zeros for the `channel` value with the channel id you copied from the last step. Once
you paste it, make sure you save the config.
> ![Paste ID](https://i.imgur.com/NicdpGw.gif)

3. Finally, if your server is running, run `ess reload` from your console, otherwise start up your server. You
should notice console output being directed to that channel! That is all you need if you're okay with the default
settings. Otherwise, if you'd like to see what other options you can use to customize console output, stick around.

4. The first thing you can customize is the format of the message sent to discord. By default, the timestamp,
level (info/warn/error/etc), and message are shown for each console message. Let's say you wanted to make the
timestamp and level bold, since this message would be using discord markdown, we can just add \*\* to both sides of
level and timestamp. Then once you've done that, just do `/ess reload` and you should see your changes on discord.
> ![Bold Format](https://i.imgur.com/jD9mH14.gif)

5. Next, you can also configure the name you wish the to show above console messages. By default, it's "EssX Console
Relay" but can be switched to anything you want.
> ![Change Name](https://i.imgur.com/xtrt1Jt.gif)

6. Finally, you can also choose to enable an option to treat any message by a user in the console channel as a
console command. This will mean that anyone who can send messages in your console channel **will be able to execute 
commands as the console**. It is suggested that you stick to the regular `/execute` command 
(see [Discord Commands](#discord-commands)) as those can be restricted to specific roles/users and are also not
restricted to the console channel.

7. That's all the options for the command relay!

## Configuring Messages
EssentialsXDiscord aims to keep its message-type system basic enough that simple things take little changes, while
giving more fine grain control to those you want it.

To give you a general overview of the system, EssentialsXDiscord allows you to define different channel IDs in the
`channels` section of the config. By default, two channels are pre-populated in the `channels` section, `primary`
and `staff`. If you only completed the initial setup, the `staff` channel definition is all zeros. This is fine in
most situations however, as the message system will always fallback to the `primary` channel if a channel ID is
invalid.

Now on the to the types of messages you can receive themselves (which is where you're going to use these channel 
definitions). In the `message-types` section of the config, you can see a list of message types (join/leave/chat/etc)
on the left (as the key), and on the right there is a channel definition.

For the sake of example lets say we want to send all chat messages to their own channel. We can do this by creating
a new channel definition and setting the `chat` message type to said channel definition. Below are step-by-step 
instructions for said example, you can follow along to get the gist of how to apply this to other use cases

1. Find the channel on discord you want to only send chat messages to and then right click the channel and click
"Copy ID".
> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/ri7NZkD.gif)

2. Next you need to create the actual channel definition, for this example we'll call it `chat`. You create a
channel definition by adding a new entry to the `channels` section with the key as its name and the id as the one
you copied in the last step.
> ![New Def](https://i.imgur.com/dc7kIkl.gif)

3. Finally, scroll down to the `message-types` section and change the `chat` message type to your newly created
channel definition. Once you do that, save and either run `/ess reload` if your server is running or start your
server.

4. That's all you need to know about the basics of the message system!

## Receive Discord Messages in Minecraft
After reading the [configuring messages section](#configuring-messages), you should now have a few discord
channels defined in the `channels` of your config. You're probably wondering how you can let your players start
to see messages from discord in minecraft chat. Say I defined a channel named `chat` in the `channels` section
of your config, and I wanted to let players see discord messages from that channel in minecraft chat; This can
be accomplished very simply by giving players the `essentials.discord.receive.chat` permission. This would relay
all discord messages from the `chat` channel to players with that permission. Another example: say I have a staff
channel in discord that I want only staff members in the minecraft server to see. Provided there is a `staff`
channel defined in the `channels` section of the config, I can give staff members the
`essentials.discord.receive.staff` permission, and they will start to see messages from that channel.

---

## Discord Commands
EssentialsXDiscord uses Discord's slash command system to let you type commands into discord without it being
seen by other people in the server. With this system, you are able to execute console commands, message players,
and see the current player list.

For example, here's what the `/execute` command looks like by default:
> ![/execute](https://i.imgur.com/yPN22bV.gif)

As you can see, you can seamlessly run commands without people seeing the content of your commands or their
response. Additionally, you can also delete the responses once you're done looking at them, so they don't clutter
your chat.

However, this is all configurable! In the `commands` section of the config, lies a ton of options to configure
settings on a per-command basis. Below are explanations of what all the configuration options mean and how to use
them.

* `enabled`
  * Default: `true`
  * Description: `Whether or not the command should be enabled and therefore shown on discord. Note that you
    must restart your minecraft server before this option takes effect.`
* `hide-command`
  * Default: `true`
  * Description: `Whether other people should not be able to see what commands you execute. Setting to false
    would allow people in the same channel as you to see exactly what command you execute. In the example below,
    you can see how disabling this option shows a message of the user and the command they executed.`
  * Example: ![Show Command](https://i.imgur.com/Q61iP4n.gif)
* `allowed-roles`
  * Description: `A list of user ids or role names/ids that are allowed to use the command. You can also use '*'
    in order to allow everyone to use the command.`
* `admin-roles`
  * `A list of user ids or role names/ids that have extra features in the command. For example, in the list
    command, admin-roles allows people to see vanished players.`

---

## Misc Permissions
EssentialsXDiscord has a few miscellanies permissions that may be important to know about;

* `essentials.discord.markdown` - Allows players to bypass the markdown filter, so that they can 
bold/underline/italic/etc their minecraft chat messages for discord.
* `essentials.discord.ping` - Allows players to bypass the ping filter, so that they can ping @everyone/@here
from minecraft chat.
