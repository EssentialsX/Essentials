# This is the config file for EssentialsX Discord.
# This config was generated for version ${full.version}.

# You need to create a bot user in order to connect your server to Discord.
# You can find instructions on this here: https://essentialsx.net/discord-tutorial

# The token for your bot from the Discord Developers site.
# Please make sure to use this site to add the bot to your server as it grants special permissions you may not be familiar with: https://essentialsx.net/discord.html
token: "INSERT-TOKEN-HERE"

# The ID of your server.
guild: 000000000000000000

# The Discord invite URL that will be shown when a player when using the /discord command or in other areas.
discord-url: "https://discord.gg/invite-code"

# Defined text channels
# =====================
# 
# Channels defined here can be used for two different purposes:
#
# Firstly, channels defined here can be used to give players permission to see messages from said channel.
# This can be done by give your players the permission node "essentials.discord.receive.<channel>".
# For example, if you wanted to let a player see messages from the primary channel, you'd give them "essentials.discord.receive.primary".
#
# Secondly, channels defined here can be used in the section below to specify which channel a message goes to.
# If a defined channel ID is invalid, the primary channel will be used as a fallback.
# If the primary channel is not defined or invalid, the default channel of the server will be used.
# If your server doesn't have any text channels, the plugin will be disabled.
# By default, two channels are defined:
# - primary, which will send basic join/leave/death/chat messages
# - staff, which will send kick/mute messages
# (note: you will need to replace the zeros with the actual channel ID you want to use)
channels:
  primary: 000000000000000000
  staff: 000000000000000000

# Should all players receive Discord messages from the primary channel, regardless of their permissions?
# This is intended for use for people without permission plugins. If you have a permission plugin, please give your
# players the essentials.discord.receive.primary permission.
