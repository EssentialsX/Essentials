# This is the config file for EssentialsXDiscord.
# This config was generated for version ${full.version}.

# You need to create a bot user in order to connect your server to Discord.
# You can find instructions on this here: #TODO write up docs

# The token for your bot from the Discord Developers site.
token: "INSERT-TOKEN-HERE"

# The ID of your server.
# #TODO tutorial
guild: 000000000000000000

# Defined text channels
# Channels defined here can be used for two different purposes;
#
# Firstly, channels defined here can be used to give players permission to see messages from said channel.
# This can be done by give your players the permission node `essentials.discord.receive.<channel>`
# For example, if you wanted to let a player see messages from the primary channel, you'd give them `essentials.discord.receive.primary`
#
# Secondly, channels defined here can be used in the section below to specify which channel a message goes to
# If a defined channel id is invalid, the primary channel will be used as a fallback
# If the primary channel is not defined or invalid, the default channel of the server will be used
# If your server doesn't have any text channels, the plugin will be disabled
# By default, two channels are defined; (You will need to replace the zeros with the actual channel id you want to use)
# - primary, which will send basic join/leave/death/chat messages
# - staff, which will send kick/mute messages
channels:
  primary: 000000000000000000
  staff: 000000000000000000

# Console relay settings
# The console relay will send every message that is sent to the console, to a discord channel
console:
  # The channel id (or webhook url) the console output should be sent to
  # If the channel id/webhook url is invalid or set to 'none', the console relay will be disabled
  # Note: If you use a channel id the bot needs the "Manage Webhooks" permission in discord or else it will not work.

# Determine which discord channels certain messages will be sent to

#
