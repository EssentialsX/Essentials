This is the info file.

This file format works for the info.txt, motd.txt and rules.txt

You can create a specific file for a user or a group:
Name it info_username.txt or info_groupname.txt

This also works with motd and rules.

Extra pages:
Type /info Colours
Type /info Tags

If you have problem viewing this file ingame, try using /einfo.
If this works, it means another command is blocking /info.

It can contain chapters like the Chapter1 below:

#Chapter1
Lines starting with # begin a new chapter
The user has to type /info Chapter1 to read this chapter

If the file starts with a # then the user is shown a chapter selection, 
when he does not select a chapter.

#Colors
Minecraft colors:
&0 &&0 &1 &&1 &2 &&2 &3 &&3
&4 &&4 &5 &&5 &6 &&6 &7 &&7
&8 &&8 &9 &&9 &a &&a &b &&b
&c &&c &d &&d &e &&e &f &&f
