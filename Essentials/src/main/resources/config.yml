  # For more information of chat formatting, check out the wiki: http://wiki.ess3.net/wiki/Chat_Formatting
  # Note: Using the {PREFIX} and {SUFFIX} placeholders along with {DISPLAYNAME} may cause double prefixes/suffixes to be shown in chat unless add-prefix-suffix is uncommented and set to false.
