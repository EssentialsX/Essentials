# This file stores cooldowns and costs for commands.

# Each filter must follow the following template keys:

# [command] - the name of an EssentialsX command; these filters will ensure that the command succeeds before charging the player or starting the cooldown
# All commands do not start with a Forward Slash (/). Instead of /msg, write msg
# Sub-commands are supported: for example, "kit tools" would be look like this:

# example:
#   command: "kit-tools"
#   cost: 1000
# which would result in a 1000 cost for "/kit tools".

# [pattern] - a regex to match any plugin's command against; these filters will not check whether the command succeeds
# Wildcards are also supported. E.g.
# - '*i*': 50
# adds a 50 second cooldown to all commands that include the letter i

# EssentialsX supports regex by starting the command with a caret ^
# For example, to target commands starting with ban and not banip the following would be used:

# example:
#   pattern: "^ban([^ip])( .*)?"
#   cooldown: 60
# which would result in a 60 seconds /ban cooldown.
# Note: If you have a command that starts with ^, then you can escape it using backslash (\). e.g. \^command: 123

# [cooldown] - the length of time that the player will have to wait until they can use a command matching this filter again, in seconds

# [cost] - the amount that will be deducted from the player's economy balance when they use the command

# You need to set at least the pattern or command.

# The "warp" example will charge 100 bucks for "/warp examplewarp", and have a cooldown of 10 seconds.
# The cooldown can be bypassed with "essentials.commandcooldowns.bypass.warp", or if you want to bypass all cooldowns: "essentials.commandcooldowns.bypass".
# The cost can be bypassed with "essentials.nocommandcost.warp", or if you want to bypass all costs: "essentials.nocommandcost.all".

# The "commands" example will charge 10000 for "/example" and "/othercommand".
# Bypass permissions are the same as above, but now with "commands" instead of "warp".
