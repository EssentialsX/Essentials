This is a fork of Essentials called EssentialsX.

If you are using this, do **NOT** ask Essentials for support.

The official upstream repository is at https://github.com/Essentials/Essentials.


Why use EssentialsX?
--------

EssentialsX is an unofficial continuation of Essentials, updated to support modern Minecraft and Spigot versions. It provides several performance enhancements and fixes that are currently not available in Essentials and Spigot-Essentials. [For more details, see the wiki.](https://essentialsx.github.io/#/Improvements)

EssentialsX is almost a completely drop-in replacement for Essentials. However, it has different requirements:

* **EssentialsX requires [Vault](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/vault/) to enable chat prefix/suffixes and group support if you have a supported permissions plugin.** We recommend using [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.github.io).

* **If you have an unsupported permissions plugin but still wish to use wildcards, enable `use-bukkit-permissions` in the configuration.** Otherwise, the plugin will fall back to config-based permissions.

* **EssentialsX requires Java 8 or higher.** On older versions, the plugin may not work properly.

* **EssentialsX supports Minecraft versions 1.8.8, 1.9.4, 1.10.2, 1.11.2, 1.12.2, 1.13.2, 1.14.4, and 1.15.2.**

Building
--------

To build EssentialsX, you need JDK 8 or higher and Maven installed on your system. Then, run the following command:
```sh
mvn clean install
```

Each module's jar can be found in `target/` inside each module's directory.

Do you want to integrate with EssentialsX in your plugin? EssentialsX is available on the **ender.zone Maven repository** at https://ci.ender.zone/plugin/repository/everything/, and the EssentialsX artifact is `net.ess3:EssentialsX:2.17.2`.
