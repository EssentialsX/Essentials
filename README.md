This is a fork of Essentials called EssentialsX.

If you are using this, do **NOT** ask Essentials for support.

The official upstream repository is at https://github.com/Essentials/Essentials.


Why use EssentialsX?
--------

EssentialsX is an unofficial continuation of Essentials, updated to support modern Minecraft and Spigot versions. It provides several performance enhancements and fixes that are currently not available in Essentials and Spigot-Essentials. [For more details, see the wiki.](https://essentialsx.github.io/#/Improvements)

EssentialsX is almost a completely drop-in replacement for Essentials. However, it has different requirements:

* **EssentialsX requires [Vault](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/vault/) to enable chat prefix/suffixes and group support if you have a supported permissions plugin.** We recommend using [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.github.io).

* **If you have an unsupported permissions plugin but still wish to use wildcards, enable `use-bukkit-permissions` in the configuration.** Otherwise, the plugin will fall back to config-based permissions.

* **EssentialsX requires Java 8 or higher.** On older versions, the plugin may not work properly.

* **EssentialsX supports Minecraft versions 1.8.8, 1.9.4, 1.10.2, 1.11.2, 1.12.2, 1.13.2 and 1.14.4.**


Support
-------

Need help with using EssentialsX? Join the [MOSS Discord community](https://discord.gg/casfFyh) to ask for help and discuss EssentialsX.

If you need to report a bug or want to suggest a new feature, you can [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials/issues/new/choose).


Building
--------

EssentialsX builds against the Spigot/CraftBukkit server software for legacy support.

To compile EssentialsX, you first need to run [BuildTools](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools).
This only needs to be done once. There are two ways to do this:

* Use the provided script at `scripts/buildtools.sh` to automatically download and run BuildTools if needed.
* Download and run BuildTools yourself for versions `1.8` and `1.8.3`.

Next, to build EssentialsX with Maven, run the following command:
```
mvn clean install
```

Each module's jar can be found in `target/` inside each module's directory.

Using EssentialsX in your plugin
