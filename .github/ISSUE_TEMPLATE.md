1.  Fill out the template, running the commands either in the console or 
    as a player. Don't simply put "latest" or we will ignore it.
2.  When linking files, do not attach them to the post! Paste them on 
    https://gist.github.com/, then paste a link to them in the relevant parts
    of the template. Avoid using Hastebin or Pastebin, as files are deleted
    after a period of time.
3.  If you are reporting an issue with lag, please include a timings report.
4.  If you are reporting an issue with messages or in-game behaviour, please
    include screenshots detailing the problem.
5.  Include a description and any other details that may be helpful under
