<!-- EssentialsX feature request guide

Fill out the template. Don't write inside the arrows as they will be hidden
when you post your issue.

Not sure if your feature fits in EssentialsX? Feel free to ask on our Discord
server: https://discord.gg/F7gexAQ

If you have a feature suggestion for EssentialsX, read the following tips:

1.  Fill out the template.
      This will help us understand what you're requesting and why you want us
      to add it.

2.  Keep it simple.
      Make sure it's easy to understand what you're requesting. A good way is
      to keep it to one request per GitHub issue, as we can then easily track
      feature requests.

3.  Check whether it has already been asked or added.
      You can search the issue tracker to see if your feature has already been
      requested at https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials/issues. You can
      also check the wiki at https://essentialsx.github.io/ to see if the
      feature was recently added.

4.  Ask yourself: "Does this belong in EssentialsX?"
      There are lots of features that we reject because most servers won't
      need or use them. If your feature is very specific or already exists in
      another plugin, it might not be a good fit for EssentialsX.

5.  Delete this line and all above lines before posting your issue!       -->
