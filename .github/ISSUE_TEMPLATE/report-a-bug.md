<!-- EssentialsX bug reporting guide

Don't put anything inside this block, as it won't be included in the issue.

If you are reporting a bug, please follow the following steps:

1.  Fill out the template in full.
      Run the commands in the console. Don't just put "latest" as a version,
      or we will ignore it.

2.  When linking files, do not attach them to the post!
      Copy and paste any logs into https://gist.github.com/, then paste a
      link to them in the relevant parts of the template. Avoid using
      Hastebin or Pastebin, as this makes providing support more difficult.
      **DO NOT drag files into this box!**

3.  If you are reporting a performance issue, please include a link to a
    Timings and/or profiler report.

4.  If you are reporting a bug with commands or something else in-game,
    please include screenshots to help us diagnose the problem.

5.  Make sure not to write between the arrows, as anything there will be
    hidden.

6.  Delete this line and all above lines before posting your issue!       -->
